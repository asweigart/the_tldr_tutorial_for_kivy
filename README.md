==========================

tl;dr You've heard about Kivy, learn it by reading this.

- You know a bit of Python programming.
- This tutorial is done on Windows 7, Kivy 1.8.0, Python 3.3. Probably applies to other platforms/versions though.
- I am not a Kivy expert yet. These are my notes, edited by other contributors. (Thanks, contributors!)
- Brevity is wit.
